Japanese Sentense Constructor


## Overview
This repository is dedicated to the development of the **Japanese Sentence Constructor**, an AI-powered language learning tool designed to help users construct Japanese sentences interactively.

## Project Objectives
- Assist users in learning Japanese sentence structure
- Provide interactive guidance instead of direct translations
- Utilize AI models to suggest and validate sentence constructions

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, LangChain, React
- **Cloud & Compute**: AWS, Azure, GCP, Hugging Face, Lightning.AI
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Development Tools**: GitHub, Gitpod, GitHub Codespaces

## Features
### **English to Japanese Sentence Construction**
- Users input an English phrase, and the app guides them through constructing the equivalent Japanese sentence
- Provides AI-powered hints and contextual grammar assistance

### **Grammar and Syntax Validation**
- Analyzes user-inputted Japanese sentences for correctness
- Provides explanations and improvements based on AI recommendations

### **Interactive Learning Experience**
- Engages users with progressively challenging sentence construction tasks
- Offers immediate feedback and learning resources

### **AI-Powered Assistance**
- Uses LLMs to suggest alternative sentence structures
- Helps learners understand nuances and variations in Japanese expressions

## Project Requirements
All development work will be committed to this repository. 
- The repository **must remain public**.
- AI model experiments and outputs should be documented in project logs.
