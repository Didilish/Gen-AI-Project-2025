# GenAI Architecting

## Overview
The **GenAI Architecting** project focuses on designing scalable, efficient, and cost-effective architectures for Generative AI workloads. This serves as a reference for AI engineers and stakeholders to navigate the technical landscape of implementing GenAI solutions.

## Business Goal
As a Solution Architect, the objective is to create architectural diagrams that help stakeholders visualize key components, technical dependencies, and infrastructure considerations when adopting GenAI.

## Architectural Approach
### **Diagram Levels**
- **Conceptual**: High-level overviews for stakeholders to understand the business value.
- **Logical**: Mid-level representation of technical components and interactions.
- **Physical**: Detailed architecture specifying infrastructure, deployment strategies, and integrations.

### **Key Considerations**
#### **Technical**
- **Infrastructure Design**: Cloud vs. on-prem, AI accelerators, multi-cloud strategies.
- **Model Selection**: SaaS vs. self-hosted, open-source vs. proprietary, context window, inference costs.
- **Data Strategy**: Collection, privacy, security, and integration.
- **Integration & Deployment**: CI/CD pipelines, API interfaces, compatibility with legacy systems.
- **Monitoring & Optimization**: Logging, telemetry, and performance feedback loops.
- **Security & Governance**: Access controls, responsible AI policies, compliance requirements.

#### **Business**
- **Use Cases**: Identifying AI-driven solutions that align with business needs.
- **Cost Considerations**: Compute size, model selection, scaling strategies.
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Designing for flexibility to transition between models and providers.

### **LLM-Specific Considerations**
- **Model Selection**: Open-source vs. proprietary, cost implications.
- **Context Enhancement**: Direct injection vs. knowledge bases.
- **Guardrails**: Input/output validation, implementation safeguards.
- **Caching Strategy**: Levels, storage, invalidation rules.
- **Agent-based Systems**: Execution actions, system integration.
