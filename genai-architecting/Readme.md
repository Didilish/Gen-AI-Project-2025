# GenAI Architecting - GenAI Workload Architecture

## Overview
This folder provides a conceptual architecture for deploying GenAI workloads, focusing on scalability, integration, and governance. It aims to guide stakeholders in understanding the technical components and considerations when adopting GenAI solutions.

## Key Components
1. **Language Portal**: Interfaces for teachers and students to access study activities.
2. **Backend**: Processes requests, interacts with the database, and connects to study modules.
3. **Study Activities**: Handles RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) processes with:
   - **Vector Database**: Stores embeddings for context.
   - **Prompt Cache**: Optimizes repeated queries.
   - **Input/Output Guardrails**: Ensures data integrity and compliance.
   - **LLM 7B**: Processes user queries with context-enhanced responses.

## Technical Considerations
- **Scalability**: Modular design supports growth.
- **Guardrails**: Input/output validation ensures responsible AI use.
- **Caching**: Reduces model latency and enhances efficiency.
- **Integration**: Supports APIs and CI/CD pipelines for seamless deployment.
- **Monitoring**: Includes KPIs, feedback loops, and cost management.

## Use Cases
- Education: AI-driven study aids and language tools.
- Business: Scalable AI integrations with robust security and governance.

## Future-Proofing
- Open-source compatibility to avoid vendor lock-in.
- Hybrid and multi-cloud support.
- Modular updates for evolving AI technologies.
